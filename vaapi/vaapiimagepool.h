 * \class VaapiImagePool
 * \brief image pool, may be used for color format conversion or video resize. for example: convert decoded surface to other format (RGBX) by vaGetImage, convert input format to another format (NV12) by vaPutImage.
 * <pre>
 * 1. for decoder, usually, the decoded surface becomes reusable after the data is converted into an VAImage, the image will be recycled from client by renderDone()
 * 2. for encoder, usually, the input image becomes reusable after the data is converted into a VASurface, simple recycle the image by recycle().
